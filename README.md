## Introduction
Nine out of ten people worldwide breathe polluted air (WHO, 2018), 
and some around four million premature deaths worldwide per year are estimated to be related to outdoor air pollution (WHO, 2016). 
It is therefore a vital need to implement long-lasting solutions that can deal with this very problem. 
One solution is to forecast sudden increases in pollution levels, and then implement necessary actions in time to the relevant stakeholders, 
allowing for the improvement of overall human welfare.

## Outline
This repository is created as a part of the course IMT4016 - Experts in Team at NTNU. 
The purpose of the project was to create a digital solution to improve overall welfare in Norway. 
In this repository, code for training an LSTM model (Long Short-term Memory model) has been uploaded. 
Furthermore, the repository also includes a raw dataset from Danmarks Plass, Bergen, which has been the foundation for model training and model inference. 
The repository also contains code for an API, which is functioning but yet to be connected to the model. 

## Summary of repository contents:
- Raw datasets
- Processed datasets
- Model creation code
- Model visualization code
- Model training code
- Models
- API code (allows for live inference)
- Code tying API to the model
- and more :)
